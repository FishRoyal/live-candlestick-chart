If you are looking for a beautiful candlestick chart that supports live data, then you have come to the right place!

### Everything for You, everything for Us!
Finding a candlestick chart is not difficult, but finding an implementation for updating the chart every second with the correct animations is much more difficult. I did not find it, and therefore I hope that I will help you, dear developers, by posting my implementation here.

### Getting Started
To start dev mode of an application, please, use these commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
To build production version
```bash
npm run build
```

### What you will find here?
I present to your attention a candlestick chart that works using d3.js, canvas, typescript, react.js, redux.js. Here is a demonstration of a chart, which is updating in real time and supports drag and zoom events. Also there is a candle generator. In addition, it is beautifully and stylishly decorated. Just for fun, the moon is rolling along the chart and at the top of the application you can see various interesting phrases about the moon which are generated by ChatGPT.

### What is inside?
[Chart.tsx](https://github.com/FishRoyal/live-candlestick-chart/blob/master/src/components/Chart/Chart.tsx) - the main component, it processes data for the graph in order to draw it in RenderLoop. In Chart.tsx you can see the usage of such custom hooks as:

- useInitial - creates a canvas and sets candle history from .json file. (If you will work with a real project, you can get it by request)
- useChartZoom, useChartTransform - zoom and transform
- useProcessMessages - it is a message worker. It gets a new, updated candle and counts xData, which is nessasary for displaying the chart, and disptches it to redux storage.
- useCountYScale - counts yScale
- useD3BindDataProcess - binds data to fake elements using d3.js, updates binded data and prepares it for rendering
- useCountMoonPoints - counts points for the moon, which will rolls along the chart

[MoonTextGenerator.tsx](https://github.com/FishRoyal/live-candlestick-chart/blob/master/src/components/MoonTextGenerator/MoonTextGenerator.tsx) - the component, which generates beautiful phrases and then draws them as typing text

[CandlesGenerator.tsx](https://github.com/FishRoyal/live-candlestick-chart/blob/master/src/components/Chart/CandlesGenerator/CandlesGenerator.tsx) - generates candles. It is an analogue to websocket.

### What else?

It's not all. There are some things to do, such as:

- [ ] Crosshairs
- [x] Ensure efficient loading of candles from the left
- [ ] Ensure smooth vertical movement of the moon when yScale changes during drag-event
- [ ] Provide ticks on the xAxis to the right of candles
- [ ] Provide a mobile version
- [ ] The moon should not teleport after attaching a date to the left
- [ ] Make sure that the application does not freeze if transferred to the active tab

### Thank you!
If you like this project or interested in it, then I'm glad :)
